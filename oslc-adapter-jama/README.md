### Installation Instructions ###

**Prerequisites**

- Install Maven v3.5 or higher from [Apache Maven Project](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi?Preferred=ftp%3A%2F%2Fmirror.reverse.net%2Fpub%2Fapache%2F) 
- Set/update environment variables M2_HOME and MAVEN_HOME pointing to your Maven folder
- Append Maven bin folder to PATH environment variable
- In command prompt, check version with following command:
`mvn --version`
- Install Java JDK 8 from [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- Make sure that the environment variable JAVA\_HOME is pointing to the JDK and not the JRE folder. JAVA\_HOME should be pointing for example to *C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_02*. Instructions to set JAVA\_HOME depending of your OS are [here](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19182-01/820-7851/inst_cli_jdk_javahome_t)


**Running the Jama OSLC adapter**

- Download this zip file [koneksys-oslc-adapter-jama.zip](https://github.com/OSLC/oslc-adapter-jama/archive/master.zip)
- Unzip it
- Open a terminal (command window) and navigate to the root folder containing the *pom.xml* file of the unzipped file 
- **Set your your Jama subdomain, username and password** in *config.properties* located in the src/main/resources folder
- Run the adapter with this command `mvn clean install wildfly:run`
- Perform `CTRL+C` to stop the adapter

### Getting Started ###

Explore OSLC Jama resources by viewing them in HTML in your browser. Navigate through OSLC resources as described in the [OSLC Core Specification](http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification) 

![](http://open-services.net/pub/Main/OSLCCoreSpecDRAFT/oslc-core-overview.png)


Start with the **Service Provider Catalog** resource (entry point resource) at [http://localhost:8080/jama-oslc-adapter/services/serviceProviderCatalog](http://localhost:8080/jama-oslc-adapter/services/serviceProviderCatalog). It will show you the Jama projects exposed by the adapter. The ServiceProviderCatalog has links to ServiceProvider resources, one for each Jama project containing an item of type Stakeholder requirement (item type id = 45).

Click on a **ServiceProvider resource** (e.g. [http://localhost:8080/jama-oslc-adapter/services/serviceProvider/Semiconductor_Sample_Set](http://localhost:8080/jama-oslc-adapter/services/serviceProvider/Semiconductor_Sample_Set)). It describes a Jama project. A ServiceProvider resource has links to **Service** resources. In the case of the Jama adapter, a Service resource has links to a **CreationFactory** and a **QueryCapability** resource. As the ServiceProvider resource contains the inline representation of the Service, CreationFRactory and QueryCapability resources, the HTML representation of the ServiceProvider directly resource displays  the details of the CreationFaactory and QueryCapability resources. The inline representation of linked resources in the ServiceProvider resource is visible when viewing the RDF representation of the ServiceProvider resource. 

Click on a **Jama Requirements Query Capability** (e.g. [http://localhost:8080/jama-oslc-adapter/services/Semiconductor_Sample_Set/requirement](http://localhost:8080/jama-oslc-adapter/services/Semiconductor_Sample_Set/requirement)). It will display all requirements contained in a a Jama project. Note: it will only display requirements of type "Stakeholder Requirement". Additional requirements types can be exposed by the adapter through additional item type-specific query capabilities or through a single query capability exposing all requirements as items with different types. The **Jama Requirements Creation Factory** resource is primarily used by applications using the adapter as a client. The Creation Factory resource therefore does not require an HTML representation. As a reminder, all HTML representations of resources provided by the adapter are optional. Only the RDF representation of resources exposed by the adapter is mandatory.  

Click on an individual Jama Requirement **resource** (e.g. [http://localhost:8080/jama-oslc-adapter/services/Semiconductor_Sample_Set/requirement/3919](http://localhost:8080/jama-oslc-adapter/services/Semiconductor_Sample_Set/requirement/3919)). It will display the main attributes of a Jama requirement. 

Access this [web page](http://localhost:8080/jama-oslc-adapter/uipreview) hosted by the adapter to test OSLC UI Preview. Hover over the link to a Jama requirement to see a UI preview window pop up. The UI Preview window can contain custom information and be formatted in various ways. The window size (height, width, and small vs large preview) information is defined according to the OSLC standard.

### Testing the adapter manually using curl or a REST client ###

- Install curl (Instructions for Windows can be found [here](http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/cloud/13_2/messagingservice/files/installing_curl_command_line_tool_on_windows.html))
- Run following curl commands in the command window, or equivalent commands in your REST client (e.g. [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)), to get the RDF representation of resources exposed by the adapter

### Testing the adapter automatically ###

- Run as Java application the class [JamaAdapterDiscoveryClient.java](./src/main/java/com/jama/oslc/client/JamaAdapterDiscoveryClient.java). It will print our in the console a summarized representation of the resources of the OSLC adapter discovered by the client using only the Service Provider Catalog resource as entry point
- Run as Java application the class [JamaAdapterPOSTClient.java](./src/main/java/com/jama/oslc/client/JamaAdapterPOSTClient.java) to test adding a new Requirement to Jama.
